The [DeckController](DeckController.md) is a high-level object that allows you to control [Stream Decks](https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/s/welcome-to-stream-deck). It builds on top of the [Stream Deck](https://github.com/abcminiuser/python-elgato-streamdeck/blob/master/src/Stream Deck/Devices/Stream Deck.py) class of the [python-elgato-streamdeck](https://github.com/abcminiuser/python-elgato-streamdeck) library.  
It manages the backgrounds, videos, labels and gives plugins and StreamController itself a nice interface.

Under normal conditions you should not need to use this object directly because all important methods are make available through the [ActionBase](../bases/ActionBase_py.md). However, if you want to write an action with more deeply integration like for example changing the background, you will need to call methods on [DeckController](DeckController.md) directly.
