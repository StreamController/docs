# 1. The Idea
The first but hardest step.  
Your presence here suggests that you might already have a brilliant concept for a plugin in your mind.

If not, I encourage you to reflect on any challenges or reccurent tasks you encounter while using your computer. Consider what could be improved or streamlined within your workflow. These pain points often serve as the perfect springboard for innovative plugin ideas that not only benefit you but also have the potential to assist others with similar needs.

You might also wannt to look at the [Elgato Marketplace](https://marketplace.elgato.com/stream-deck/plugins) to see if there are any plugins you would like to see on [StreamController](https://github.com/StreamController/StreamController).

## Suggestions 
If you really struggle to find an idea, here's my list of plugins I would really like to see:

- [x] Clock
- [ ] Days until
- [x] Discord integration
- [ ] Emoji board
- [ ] [Gnome Calendar](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Calendar) integration
- [x] [Gnome Window Control](https://gnome.org) (move windows on [Gnome](https://gnome.org))
- [x] Simulate mouse movement and clicks
- [x] Speedtest

Feel free to use any of these suggestions without giving any credit.
