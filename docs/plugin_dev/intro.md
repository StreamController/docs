# Plugin Development

No single application can fullfill the unique needs and preferences of every user. That's why StreamController allows users to tailor their experience by developing their own plugins. 

[StreamController](https://github.com/Core447/StreamController) features enhanced plugin support, enabling developers like you to easily create plugins using [Python](https://python.org). The choice of [Python](https://python.org) as the core language for [StreamController](https://github.com/Core447/StreamController) wasn't arbitrary; it was selected for its simplicity and ease of learning, making it an ideal choice for plugin development.

## No [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/s/welcome-to-stream-deck)?
No problem, just use a FakeDeck!

FakeDecks are emulated original [Stream Decks](https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/s/welcome-to-stream-deck) for testing purposes, allowing you to test and develop plugins without any physical [Stream Decks](https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/s/welcome-to-stream-deck).

### Enable FakeDecks
1. Open Settings
2. Go to Developer Settings
3. Increase the number of FakeDecks (max 3)
